Git clone vs. fork
When a Git repository is cloned, the target repository remains shared amongst all of the developers who had previously contributed to it. Other developers who had previously contributed to that codebase will continue to push their changes and pull updates from the cloned repository. Any developer who clones a repository can synchronize their copy of the codebase with any updates made by fellow developers.
In contrast to a clone, a Git fork operation will create a completely new copy of the target repository. The developer who performs the fork will have complete control over the newly copied codebase. Developers who contributed to the Git repository that was forked will have no knowledge of the newly forked repo. Previous contributors will have no means with which they can contribute to or synchronize with the Git fork unless the developer who performed the fork operation provides access to them.
